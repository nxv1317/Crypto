# Disclaimer
These scripts are just exmaples. If you wish to use encryption in a production encrionment then it is recommended that you use more industry ready libraries which are maintained by cryptographers, PHD students and people in the security industry, such as: https://pynacl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
