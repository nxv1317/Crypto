# Crypto
In this project I will be showing code examples of different ciphers written in the Python programming language. 

# Disclaimer
These scripts are just exmaples to learn about cryptographic techniques. If you are unsure about the field of crypography and wish to use it in a production envrionment, then it is recommended that you use more industry ready libraries which are maintained by cryptographers, PHD students and people in the security industry, such as: https://pynacl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
